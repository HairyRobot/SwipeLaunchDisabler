As of Jelly Bean, it is possible to quick launch an app (Google Now by default) by a swipe up gesture from the navigation bar, this feature can be annoying.

This app is developed to "disable" this feature. Actually the feature is not disabled, but instead launches this app that does nothing.

For Marshmallow (Android 6), it is possible to disable the assist feature.
Follow below steps:

1. goto "Settings > Apps > Advanced (the small gear icon) > Default Apps > Assists & voice input"
1. select "none"
